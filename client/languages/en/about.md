# About Learn Anything

Learn Anything is the platform for knowledge discovery that helps you understand any
topic through the **most efficient paths**, as voted by the community. Each topic
has an Interactive Map with nodes to other subtopics, external links and resources.

# Community & Contributing

This project is [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) and is in active development.

Anyone who wishes to contribute to it, can help by either improving the content of all the topics and adding links with resources or by helping with the development and contributing to new features of the website or you can join our growing community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/KKYdWjt) and ask questions there.

# Keep the project going

This project is built by the community, for the community and in our goals to
make the most efficient paths and the best user experience possible in exploring the
maps and finding the resources you need, we can only rely on donations made
by our users to sustain this project.

There are **no advertisements** and **no sponsored content** as that would be against
our vision of making the best and most optimal learning tracks for learning any topic.

We created a **[Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/learnanything)** where you can
support our work. Any donation that you make to this project is incredibly valuable
to keep this project going. We also have some awesome rewards that come with your support.
