The image above is an [interactive mind map that can be viewed and explored](https://learn-anything.xyz/learn-anything) as well as [searched through](https://learn-anything.xyz). 🔎

There are **many mind maps inside** which show the **best step by step guides you can use to learn any subject in depth**. 
  
Each node with a link has an emoji attached to show where this node leads on the internet. Nodes with 🗺 link to other mind maps. 

Just search for what you wish to learn or [simply explore](https://learn-anything.xyz/learn-anything).

There is also a video introduction to the website, you can watch [here](https://youtu.be/_zYjS2Uicso).
  
If you think that there is a better way one can learn the subject or you wish something was added or you found a mistake, you can help improve it by clicking the *'impove this map'* button in the bottom right corner of the site. 

The website is also [fully open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) and you can help improve it. 💙

The [main goal of this project](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/learn-anything/wiki/Future-of-learning) is to **expose human knowledge in a visual and structured way to accelerate learning**. 

For more information, please read our [wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps/wiki) and join our active [Slack channel](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ).


## Community
Both this project and the search engine [is in active development](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything). 

If you want to help improve it in any way or want to join an ever growing community of learners, you can join our active [Slack group](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) where you can either help with expanding content of the mind maps, help with the [development](https://github.com/learn-anything/search-engine) and adding features to the website or you can create a study group for any branch in the mind map and learn together.  

## Contributing
We made a [wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps/wiki) that covers [all the different ways](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps/wiki/Contributing) in which you can help this project evolve and become better. 

In there, you can also find [why we created this website and what problems we are trying to solve](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps/wiki/Future-of-learning) as well as [our official Roadmap of challenges we have yet to solve](https://github.com/learn-anything/maps/wiki/Roadmap). 

We use [Slack](https://knowledge-map.slack.com/shared_invite/MTgxNTYzMjIzNjM5LTE0OTQzMzA4MDAtYzY1YWY0ZDc0NQ) for any in-project communication and you can ask any questions you have there.

This project can only become what it is with your help. Thank you. 

## Keep this project going 💜
This project is **built by the community, for the community** and in our goals to make the most efficient paths and the best user experience possible in exploring the mind maps and finding the resources you need, we can only rely on donations made by our users to sustain this project.

There are **no advertisements** and **no sponsored content** in this Search Engine as that would defeat our vision of making the best and most optimal learning tracks for learning any topic in the world.
 
We have created a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/learnanything) where you can support our work. Any donation that you make to this project is incredibly valuable to keep this project going. We also have some awesome rewards that come with your support.  

Thank you. 💚

## Stay in touch
You can follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/learnanything_) where we announce any new awesome changes that were added to the Search Engine.

We also have our own internal [development blog](http://blog.learn-anything.xyz) where we write about interesting challenges we have solved on our way to make the website and curation of Mind Maps the best it can be.
